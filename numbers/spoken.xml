    At the age of fifteen, he had already learned silence,
    from "A Child's History of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan

    As Paul fought the 'thopter's controls, he grew aware that he was sorting
    out the interwoven storm forces, his more than Mentat awareness computing on the
    basis of fractional minutiae. He felt dust fronts, billowings, mixings of
    turbulence, an occasional vortex.

    The cabin interior was an angry box lighted by the green radiance of
    instrument dials. The tan flow of dust outside appeared featureless, but his
    inner sense began to see through the curtain.

    I must find the right vortex, he thought.

    For a long time now he had sensed the storm's power diminishing, but still
    it shook them. He waited out another turbulence.

    The vortex began as an abrupt billowing that rattled the entire ship. Paul
    defied all fear to bank the 'thopter left.

    Jessica saw the maneuver on the attitude globe.

    "Paul!" she screamed.

    The vortex turned them, twisting, tipping. It lifted the 'thopter like a
    chip on a geyser, spewed them up and out — a winged speck within a core of
    winding dust lighted by the second moon.

    Paul looked down, saw the dust-defined pillar of hot wind that had disgorged
    them, saw the dying storm trailing away like a dry river into the desert — moon-
    gray motion growing smaller and smaller below as they rode the updraf t .

    "We're out of it," Jessica whispered.

    Paul turned their craft away from the dust in swooping rhythm while he
    scanned the night sky.

    "We've given them the slip," he said.

    Jessica felt her heart pounding. She forced herself to calmness, looked at
    the diminishing storm. Her time sense said they had ridden within that
    compounding of elemental forces almost four hours, but part of her mind computed
    the passage as a lifetime. She felt reborn.

    It was like the litany, she thought. We faced it and did not resist. The
    storm passed through us and around us. It's gone, but we remain.

    "I don't like the sound of our wing motion," Paul said. "We suffered some
    damage in there."

    He felt the grating, injured flight through his hands on the controls. They
    were out of the storm, but still not out into the full view of his prescient
    vision. Yet, they had escaped, and Paul sensed himself trembling on the verge of
    a revelation.

    He shivered.

    The sensation was magnetic and terrifying, and he found himself caught on
    the question of what caused this trembling awareness. Part of it, he felt, was
    the spice-saturated diet of Arrakis. But he thought part of it could be the
    litany, as though the words had a power of their own.

    "I shall not fear ..."



    Cause and effect: he was alive despite malignant forces, and he felt himself
    poised on a brink of self-awareness that could not have been without the
    litany's magic.

    Words from the Orange Catholic Bible rang through his memory: "What senses
    do we lack that we cannot see or hear another world all around us?"
    "There's rock all around," Jessica said.

    Paul focused on the 'thopter's launching, shook his head to clear it. He
    looked where his mother pointed, saw uplifting rock shapes black on the sand
    ahead and to the right. He felt wind around his ankles, a stirring of dust in
    the cabin. There was a hole somewhere, more of the storm's doing.

    "Better set us down on sand," Jessica said. "The wings might not take full
    brake . "

    He nodded toward a place ahead where sandblasted ridges lifted into
    moonlight above the dunes. "I'll set us down near those rocks. Check your safety
    harness . "

    She obeyed, thinking: We've water and stillsuits. If we can find food, we
    can survive a long time on this desert. Fremen live here. What they can do we
    can do.

    "Run for those rocks the instant we're stopped," Paul said. "I'll take the
    pack . "
